    "Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "Answer--\n",
    "Bayes' theorem, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental \n",
    "concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the probability \n",

    "    Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "    Answer--Choosing the appropriate type of Naive Bayes classifier for a given problem depends\n",
    "    on several factors including the nature of the data, assumptions about independence among \n",
    "    features, and the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Here's a brief overview of\n",
    "    the three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers and considerations for choosing among them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable for continuous or numerical data where features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
    "Assumes that features are continuous and that their values are sampled from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "Works well when the features in the dataset are approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "May not perform well if the features are not normally distributed or if there are strong deviations from normality.\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed for text classification tasks where features represent word counts or frequencies (e.g.,\n",
    "                                                                                            bag-of-words representation).\n",
    "Well-suited for problems involving discrete features or counts, such as document classification, \n",
    "spam filtering, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "Assumes that features represent the frequencies with which certain events occur in the dataset.\n",
    "Works well when dealing with text data or categorical features with multiple levels.\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Multinomial Naive Bayes but assumes that features are binary (e.g., presence or absence of a word).\n",
    "Particularly useful for binary feature vectors such as document term presence/absence or binary indicators.\n",
    "Suitable for problems where only the occurrence or absence of features matters, regardless of their frequency.\n",
    "May not be suitable for problems where the frequency of features is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Assignment:\n",
    "You have a dataset with two features, X1 and X2, and two possible classes, A and B. You want to use Naive\n",
    "Bayes to classify a new instance with features X1 = 3 and X2 = 4. The following table shows the frequency of\n",
    "each feature value for each class:\n",
    "Class X1=1 X1=2 X1=3 X2=1 X2=2 X2=3 X2=4\n",
    "A 3 3 4 4 3 3 3\n",
    "B 2 2 1 2 2 2 3\n",
    "Assuming equal prior probabilities for each class, which class would Naive Bayes predict the new instance\n",
